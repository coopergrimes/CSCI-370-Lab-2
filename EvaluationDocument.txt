Our game was deisnged to have a snail that was able to get out of their enclosure. The snail is tasked to find 
his enclosure before his owner gets home. The snail moves by using arrow keys. Some areas are blocked off, and there are doors
that lead to different scenes to explore. There are also objects that give dialogue reminding the snail to find its way back to its enclosure.


Mitchell: 
	This project was fun for me because using the tile maps was pretty cool. I liked how everything fit together, and how unity made 
	it easy to work with everything. I also liked figuring out how to transition between scenes, becuase it will help me alot with 
	later games. Some things that were hard were managing scenes. I was confused on how the event system and game manager tranfered
	to each new scene, but i think i eventually figured it out.
	
	I worked on created each scene and makeing links between them. I also worked on getting the player to move around and having 
	the camera follow. I also worked on getting the game to restart when the snail reached its destination.
